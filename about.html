			<p>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2013. The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Initially rooted in hip hop, the group’s musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an aternative universe storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several world tours.</p>

<p>The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: 방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈少年團), literally meaning "Bulletproof Boy Scouts". According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets".[3][4] In Japan, they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団), which translates similarly.[5] In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as part of their new brand identity.[6] This extended their name to mean "growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward."[7]</p>
